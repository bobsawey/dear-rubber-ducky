Dear Rubber Ducky,

think I may have figured out a way to store 1 hour of audio, immutably, on the ethereum blockchain for roughly $4 a pop
if only I could do that with Star Wars kid

but yeah, this would mean every bit of the file has been confirmed many times over therefore pretty much making data loss within the next 500 years fairly impossible

ipfs still has corruption issues

still need to build a check in somehow that proves the file pushed onto the chain isn't corrupt the moment it is pushed

**_that might be augmented with a crosschain solution where parity bits of the file are pushed as it is encoded
yeah that actually makes all the sense_**

Thanks rubber ducky.

Sincerely,
Bobby Jo
